Here is a story. March 24th, 2023 was the day my younger brother Max found out he did not get into his dream high school in San Francisco, Lowell High School. Max was disappointed, naturally. I felt bad for him because he studied really hard just to get rejected by his dream school. So I thought to myself, there's nothing I can do now to change the fact that he did not get into his first choice. But what if, I can make a difference in what colleges he could get into, because last thing I want to see Max doing is beating himself up so bad he gives up on school entirely.

With that as motivation, I set out to collect information and data about college admissions. And I started the search at the University of California Systems -- the prestigious colleges of California at least half the price of a private institution.

And Here, are my findings.
